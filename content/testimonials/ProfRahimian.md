To whom it may concern,

It is a pleasure to recommend such a distinguished individual as Mr. Omid Shenavar for graduate studies toward a Ph.D. degree. I have known Mr. Shenavar for seven years, since his admission to the MS program in Plant Pathology at Sari Agricultural Science and Natural Resources University (SANRU). He has been a student of mine in the plant pathogenic bacteria course, in which he ranked in the top five percent of over 160 students I have taught at SANRU and the University of Tehran, in the past 33 years. Acting as the chairman of his thesis committee, I have been pleased of his quality of work, as well as his initiatives and industriousness. The results of his thesis work has been published in the journal Plant Pathology and presented in some national conferences.

Omid's command of the English language is very good and is proficient in listening, reading comprehension, and communication in English. He has a pleasant personality and interacts very well with fellow students in research and lab works, especially those dealt with phylogenetic issues. Students as gifted as Mr. Shenavar are rare, because of his excellent performance, ability, sincerity, and devotion to work, I expect him to become a successful Ph.D. student and researcher. I can recommend him highly and without reservation as a Ph.D. candidate, researcher, and a gentleman.

Truly,

Heshmat Rahimian

Professor of Plant Pathology and Microbiology
