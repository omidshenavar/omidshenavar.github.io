## Who am I?

Hey there, I'm Omid Shenavar, a graduate of Shiraz University with a B.Sc. and SANRU with an M.Sc., where I dove into the fascinating world of plant protection and bacteriology. My studies have really ignited a passion for bacterial taxonomy, phylogeny, and biodiversity. But you know what? My hunger for knowledge in these areas is insatiableâ€”I'm always up for learning more and broadening my horizons.

From day one, my dream has been to become a bona fide expert in plant bacteriology. That's why I jumped at the chance to continue my studies at SANRU, guided by the legendary Professor Rahimian, a true rockstar in the world of phytobacteriology. Under his mentorship, my passion has only grown, and I'm incredibly grateful for his guidance.

Now, I'm on a mission to snag a Ph.D. spot in plant bacteriology. My goal? To shake things up in the world of plant science with my research and expertise. I'm dead set on making an impact, and I won't rest until I've reached the top of my game.

And hey, wanna see how determined I am? Check out these pics. The one from 2017? That's where I started. But with some serious dedication and hard work, I've managed to shed over 50 kilograms. Talk about a transformation, right?
