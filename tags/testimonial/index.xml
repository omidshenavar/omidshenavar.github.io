      <description>It is a pleasure to recommend such a distinguished individual as Mr. Omid Shenavar for graduate studies toward a Ph.D. degree. I have known Mr. Shenavar for seven years, since his admission to the MS program in Plant Pathology at Sari Agricultural Science and Natural Resources University (SANRU). He has been a student of mine in the plant pathogenic bacteria course, in which he ranked in the top five percent of over 160 students I have taught at SANRU and the University of Tehran, in the past 33 years.</description>
